 Tony Saich on What Chinese Want From Their Leaders 



In an election season, Americans are bombarded almost daily with opinion polls that measure not only the popularity of candidates but people’s satisfaction with their own lives and the state of the nation. In China, reliable public opinion polls are few and far between, but they do exist. The Ash Center at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard has been working for more than a decade with Horizon Research in Beijing to measure Chinese citizens’ attitudes toward their government.
Last year, they polled 3,500 people in cities, towns, villages and the countryside for their views on different levels of government. In surveys going back to 2003, respondents generally gave the central government in Beijing high marks, but satisfaction declined sharply for local officials. In 2014, respondents’ satisfaction with the government’s anticorruption efforts reached a new high, coinciding with President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on official graft.
In an interview, Tony Saich, a professor at the Kennedy School and the director of the Ash Center, discussed the survey’s findings and their implications for the stability of the Chinese government as economic growth slows.

Q.
You have written that Chinese citizens have increasing expectations of their government. On one hand, they want more freedom to make their own economic decisions, but on the other, they want the government to protect them from the “vicissitudes of the market.” Has this dynamic changed under Xi Jinping’s tenure?

A.
From our most recent survey [in 2014], attitudes have remained pretty much the same with the one exception, not surprisingly, of government actions to curb corruption. On the whole, citizens are more satisfied with services that a strong state and the planning apparatus are good at delivering, such as building infrastructure and providing social safety. By contrast, they are most concerned about the risks that a move to market forces creates, such as employment issues and the new problems created in the reform era involving environmental health and corruption.

Q.
There’s a widely held view that the legitimacy of the Communist Party rests on its ability to deliver economic growth. But for ordinary Chinese citizens, at what point does dissatisfaction with a slowing economy become a threat to the regime? Has past performance given the party some room for policy errors, such as the response to the stock market crash?

A.
Certainly the party has portrayed itself as a competent economic leadership and has taken pains to attribute China’s development to its policy choices. This underplays, of course, the important role that China’s people have played in this success, often in spite of restrictive government policies. This is why the party under Xi has been seeking to broaden the base of its legitimacy and has promoted pride in the nation and nationalism. Under Xi, the party has drawn an even tighter bond between itself and the nation, so that criticism of the party can be interpreted as unpatriotic. It has striven to render history in such a way that the party is the natural inheritor of Chinese tradition — a wild cry from the days of the Cultural Revolution, when the party was determined to undermine tradition and portrayed itself as representing a radical break with the past.
Whether this will be sufficient is hard to say. Regimes appear strong until they start to unravel and then we can all point out why they were never as strong as they appeared. That said, the control over public discourse and the credit that the party takes for previous success may give it more scope for policy mistakes. The party has always been adept at finding scapegoats for when things go wrong and then moving on with policy shifts.

Q.
The surveys you’ve conducted over the past decade show a declining level of satisfaction with local government. With Mr. Xi’s crackdown on corruption, has there been any perceptible change in people’s attitudes? If so, would this in any way counteract the negative effects of a slowing economy?

A.
The 2014 survey shows the same trend with citizen satisfaction dropping the closer government gets to interaction with the people. This is important because the vast majority of public services are provided through the lower levels of government.
Satisfaction with the central government has remained consistently high — 92.8 percent are satisfied with performance, of whom 37.6 percent are extremely satisfied — but satisfaction with county, district and lower levels is at the lowest ebb since we started polling in 2003. At the township level, only 7.8 percent were extremely satisfied and 47 percent relatively satisfied. This gives the central government some respite, as most people seem to see the problems as ones of implementation and poor local officialdom rather than as stemming from central policy or being systemic.
The two main negatives are that citizens feel that a majority of officials seek to get too close to those with money and “suck up” to superiors rather than serving the interests of ordinary people. In all our previous surveys, combating corruption was seen as the worst area of government work, but this improved in 2014. The award now goes to land management. Still, only 44.2 percent of respondents thought that government officials were honest. They did feel, however, that government was making greater efforts to combat corruption and 48.4 percent thought that gift giving and bribes had declined.
The hope remains for the central leaders that people continue to see the abuses as local aberrations and that the central government is still seen to be striving to work in their best interests. Local protests would thus be easier to contain.

Q.
To what extent does an angry working class pose a threat to the party? An angry middle class? An angry elite? How can dissatisfaction manifest itself among those three groups?

A.
It seems that strikes, go-slows and other industrial activity have been increasing, but the party survived much more easily than many of us predicted the big shakeout of the industrial sector in the late 1990s. As long as the protests remain against specific material grievances and locally focused, the regime does not have much to fear from the declining working class.
The threat might be more significant from the middle classes and the elites. However, neither of these two groups are likely to risk their well-being under the current system unless things really deteriorate or unless there seems to be a viable alternative to party rule. These two possibilities do not seem to be on the cards at the moment. In fact, the better educated and the wealthier are the most satisfied with government performance. Yet the poor environment and the stock market crash and incompetence in dealing with it both affect these two groups, and the party needs to tread carefully in these domains.
Environmental health and management have both risen as major concerns since we starting polling in 2003, and citizens feel that government is not doing enough in these areas. With the collapse in the housing market, the government talked up the stock market as a venue for the middle class to earn returns — while, of course, inflating share prices of state-owned enterprises to help keep them going — and that boom seems to be declining.
The crucial question for the party is whether it can keep producing sufficient largess to keep the middle class and its own elites on board. As long as it can do that, it does not seem in danger. If it cannot, these two groups might look around for an alternative — hard to find given that all have been squashed. The one clear lesson from [the Tiananmen protests of] 1989 was that when even the party elites thought the system might be in danger and that there might be an alternative, they were willing to contemplate deserting the ship.

Q.
In 1989, one could argue that the government did lose control, if only for a while, and had to violently reassert it. Economic conditions then were pretty bad as well, and this year’s growth is set to be the slowest since 1990. How has the landscape changed for the party and its ability to respond to unrest? How big a role do the greatly expanded and modernized security forces, such as the People’s Armed Police, play in that?

A.
I think that the forces under control of the party have trained extensively in crowd control and would seek to prevent any demonstration getting to the scale that it did in 1989. However, this brings us back to the question of elite unity.
As long as the elites stay together and issue one message, then any unrest can be dealt with. The problem in 1989 was the major divide within the elite that became public, allowing a space and a period of time when there were no clear orders or even what were interpreted as conflicting orders. In the end, 1989 was never about whether the protesters would achieve some kind of victory, but which group within the elite would prevail.
